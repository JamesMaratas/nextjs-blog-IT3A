        <p> I&apos;m James Bryan F. Maratas. My hobbies are playing basketball, online games, swimming, listening to music, dance, singing. My favorite food is buttered garlic shrimp.
 I take the IT course because it is my 3rd choice actually, my 1st and 2nd choice didn&apos;t go as it planned due to some financial problem so that&apos;s why my 3rd choice was the only choice that I had.
I want to improve my learning and skills here in IT so I%apos;ll be able to produce enough and decent skills to work for a decent company. Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to strengthen my weaknesses and use them as my strenght 10 years from now.</p>
